# LINUX FOR DEVOPS — FOUNDATION NOTES (Mohammed Sohail)

## 🔹 What We Have Learned So Far

---

# 1️⃣ Linux Filesystem Basics

## What is `/` ?

* `/` is the **root directory**
* It is the top of the entire Linux filesystem
* Everything starts from `/`
* Similar to `C:\` in Windows

Example:

* `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` → absolute path
* `etc` → relative path (depends on current location)

---

# 2️⃣ Important Directories

| Directory | Purpose                    |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| /home     | User home directories      |
| /etc      | System configuration files |
| /var      | Logs and changing data     |
| /usr      | Installed programs         |
| /opt      | Optional applications      |
| /tmp      | Temporary files            |
| /root     | Root user's home           |

---

# 3️⃣ Absolute vs Relative Path

Absolute Path:

* Starts with `/`
* Always same location
* Example: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

Relative Path:

* Does not start with `/`
* Depends on current directory
* Example: `cd etc` (goes to ./etc, not /etc)

---

# 4️⃣ Users & Groups

Every file has:

* Owner
* Group

Example:

```
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu devops test.txt
```

Breakdown:

* Owner → ubuntu
* Group → devops
* Others → everyone else

Linux checks permissions in this order:

1. If you are owner → owner permissions apply
2. Else if you are in file's group → group permissions apply
3. Else → others permissions apply

Linux does NOT combine permissions.
It stops at first match.

---

# 5️⃣ UID & GID

Every user has:

* UID (User ID)
* GID (Group ID)

Check with:

```
id
```

Linux internally uses numbers (UID/GID), not usernames.

---

# 6️⃣ chmod (Change Permissions)

Permissions:

* r = 4
* w = 2
* x = 1

Numeric Examples:

| Number | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| 7      | rwx     |
| 6      | rw-     |
| 5      | r-x     |
| 4      | r--     |

Common permission sets:

| Type              | Permission |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Script            | 755        |
| Config file       | 644        |
| Private key       | 600 or 400 |
| Private directory | 700        |

Difference:

* `chmod +x file` → adds execute
* `chmod 755 file` → sets exact permission

In DevOps, numeric mode is preferred (predictable state).

---

# 7️⃣ chown (Change Owner)

Change owner:

```
sudo chown user file
```

Change owner and group:

```
sudo chown user:group file
```

Owner and group are separate.

Important:
User must exist, or command fails.

---

# 8️⃣ > vs >> (Redirection)

`>` → overwrite file
`>>` → append to file

Example:

```
echo "hello" > file.txt   # replaces content
echo "world" >> file.txt  # adds to bottom
```

Never overwrite logs accidentally in production.

---

# 9️⃣ Directory Permissions

For directories:

| Permission | Meaning                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| r          | List files                |
| w          | Create/delete files       |
| x          | Enter (cd into directory) |

Execute on directory = ability to enter.

Without `x`, you cannot cd into it.

---

# 🔟 Nginx + Linux Connection

From nginx.conf:

```
user www-data;
```

Nginx worker runs as `www-data`.

If `/var/www/html` is:

```
drwx------ root root
```

Then:

* www-data cannot enter
* You get 403 error

Services run as specific users.
Permissions must allow that user access.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ Port & Process Understanding

Check running nginx:

```
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Check listening ports:

```
sudo ss -tulpn | grep 80
```

Flow:
Client → Port 80 → Nginx → File system

---

# 🔥 What You Understand Now

✔ Linux filesystem structure
✔ Absolute vs relative path
✔ Users & groups
✔ Permission model (owner → group → others)
✔ chmod numeric system
✔ chown ownership control
✔ Directory permission behavior
✔ Basic nginx + Linux permission relationship
✔ Port binding basics

You are approximately 95% strong in Linux permission & filesystem fundamentals.

# 🚀 What We Will Learn Next

## Phase 2 — Advanced Linux for DevOps

1. Special permissions

   * setuid
   * setgid
   * sticky bit
   * Why /tmp works differently

2. Process management deep dive

   * ps
   * top
   * kill
   * nice / renice
   * background jobs

3. Systemd deep understanding

   * service lifecycle
   * enable vs start
   * journalctl logs
   * writing custom service

4. Networking deep dive

   * ss
   * netstat
   * curl debugging
   * ip route
   * firewall basics

5. Log analysis mindset

   * tail -f
   * journalctl
   * grep in logs
   * debugging 502 / 403 errors

6. Real DevOps debugging simulation

# 🧠 DevOps Mindset You Developed

When something fails, think:

* Which user is running the service?
* Does that user have permission?
* Which port is it using?
* Is service running?
* Are logs showing errors?

That is production thinking.

---

# 🔥 Current Level

Linux user → ✅
Linux confident → ✅
Permission expert → almost ✅
Production debugging mindset → developing

---

# Next Session Goal

Move from filesystem mastery → service & process mastery.

We will start with:
Special permissions + real debugging case.
